# The Internet of Energy
For a couple of month the idea of Jeremy Rifkin, an American economic and social theorist, writer, public speaker, political advisor, and activist <sup>1</sup>, to implement an internet of energy is stuck somewhere in the back of my head.

Rifkin speaks of generating energy ressources from every households roof by solar panels, wind generators and heat exchangers in the ground. Every household, and this system is currently beeing implemented in Denmark and Germany will provide its share of energy to a smart grid of energy storage and consumers. The energy need will be balanced in a smart fashion so that there is always enough energy at high demand hotspots.

But these developments and new innovations, which effect everyone of us, are mostly research driven by highly educated specialists and behind closed curtains in energy producing organisations and their research and development departements.

#### Applying the WWW knowledge to the energy internet

Rifkin adresses the similarities to the internet of communication, that we are used to for a couple of years now, the good old WWW. We have learned to scale software to be able to serve hundreds of thousands of requests per minute and we also learned to balance the load across available ressources and queue and store data as we need and can process them.

These developments have recently been pushed by open source contributions of a large community of intelligent and innovative people. It has so to say been crowdsourced. The WWW research and developments have been open and a lot of people are contributing. Most recently we are developing applications we classify as "The Internet of Things" and these developments are possible due to the easy access to prototyping tools, such as the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) microcontroller board, to name just one of these innovations.

We have cheap and easy prototyping tools to solve problems on the internet of communication and the WWW developers and thinkers have best practices in their pockets on how to solve large scale problems well.

*Can't we apply this knowledge to the internet of energy?*

#### What we need is energy prototyping devices

In order to apply this knowledge and the generous intelligence of a crowd of intelligent people we need prototyping tools such as the Arduino microcontroller, that everybody can hook up on their office desk, to play around with energy problems.

## What problems could be solved?

* The other day I was driving my car down a german motorway and saw on my right hand side a field of wind turbines, our push forwards into green energy production. On the other side I looked at lines and lines of electricity wires. For the internet of communication we have solved this wire problem by going wireless. **We need wireless energy transmission!**
* The dilemma with solarpanels is that they create the energy when the need and demand for it is lesser than it is, when they cannot provide their energy - at nighttime. In order to solve this problem, **we need energy storage solutions that can store the energy produced at any point and elastically provide the energy when needed**
