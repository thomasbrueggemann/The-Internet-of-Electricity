# The Internet of Electricity
For a couple of month the idea of Jeremy Rifkin, an American economic and social theorist, writer, public speaker, political advisor, and activist <sup>1</sup>, to implement an internet of energy is stuck somewhere in the back of my head.

Rifkin speaks of generating energy ressources from every households roof by solar panels, wind generators and heat exchangers in the ground. Every household, and this system is currently beeing implemented in Denmark and Germany will provide its share of energy to a smart grid of energy storage and consumers. The energy need will be balanced in a smart fashion so that there is always enough energy at high demand hotspots.

But these developments and new innovations, which effect everyone of us, are mostly research driven by highly educated specialists and behind closed curtains in energy producing organisations and their research and development departements.

Rifkin adresses the similarities to the internet of communication, that we are used to for a couple of years now, the good old WWW. We have learned to scale software to be able to serve hundreds of thousands of requests per minute and we also learned to balance the load across available ressources and queue and store data as we need and can process them.

These developments have recently been pushed by open source contributions of a large community of intelligent and innovative people. It has so to say been crowdsourced. The WWW research and developments have been open and a lot of people are contributing. Most recently we are developing applications we classify as "The Internet of Things" and these developments are possible due to the easy access to prototyping tools, such as the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) microcontroller board, to name just one of these innovations.
